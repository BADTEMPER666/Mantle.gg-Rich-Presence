About Mantle

Mantle is revolutionizing the Minecraft cape scene, use our free and easy system to access a plethora of awesome capes. Anyone else using Mantle can see your capes, compatible with Lunar, Badlion, Optifine, Forge, or pretty much any other client.

Are you tired of having to purchase a cape on every single client, or annoyed when you realise your friends cant see your cool cape because they don't use lunar or badlion client.

At Mantle we are truly building a cape system that will stand the test of time, with focus on quality, stability, compatibility, and community.
